# cover-letter

I decided to create this to solve a problem I have, which is that I write a unique cover letter for every company, whether they read it or not. I don't want to be left wondering, should I have put in the extra effort? I think it is always worth it to put in the extra effort.

The problem? This is extremely time consuming. Where do you put all these variations? Copy and pasting multiple paragraphs of text in your notes is not fun and you can be like me and just write over the old paragraphs each time, but then you lose content you wrote that might be useful later.

What if there was a builder that would take care of some of the basics and allow me to weave sentences or chunks in and out based on the themes of that position? For example I would write something a little different if the company is looking for someone design oriented. I am very design oriented, so I would love to tell you about that. However the primary focus of another company might be different, even if their design is great. I want to be able to quickly put something together, while also not being constrained to the exact formula, so ideally all of this is editable.

This is what I started creating. I will update this README as I build out more pieces. Stay tuned. For now, I'm using my own data in the store until I can implement either a local storage or Firebase solution. This is a ways off from being usable for others.

### In the Future

Next, I'd like the user to be able to create their own sentences and paragraph chunks associated with certain topics that they themselves can add. You know yourself and what positions you're looking at. You can figure in advance what themes you might come across. When you are in construction mode, ideally you can check off options pertinent to the current company, and it will build out the paragraph for you. The great thing about the editor is if anything is wonky or you simply want to add in some extra flare, it's easy to edit in place.

Some things to expect: tabs in the sidebar for different sections, a button to copy the letter, a reset button in case you went wild while free editing and want to go back to the original state, a quality PDF export would be _really_ nice ...
